This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews to determine whether a review is positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis is a key component in understanding customer feedback and can be used to improve products, services, and customer experiences.

## Features

### Data Preprocessing
The project includes extensive data cleaning, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization, to prepare text data for analysis.

### Feature Extraction
Techniques like Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) are used to convert text data into numerical features.

### Machine Learning Models
Various machine learning algorithms are implemented, including:
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees

### Deep Learning Models
The project also explores deep learning approaches using neural networks such as:
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)
- Bidirectional LSTM/GRU

### Evaluation Metrics
Performance of the models is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
